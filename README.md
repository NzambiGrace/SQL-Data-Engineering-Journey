# SQL Learning Journey

Welcome to my **SQL Learning Journey**!

This repository is a personal collection of SQL scripts that document my exploration of database management and data manipulation using Postgresql. 
Each script reflects a significant concept I've encountered and practiced, marking milestones in my development as a SQL enthusiast.

## About This Repository

This repository is more than just a set of scripts; it's a log of my experiences, challenges, and discoveries in SQL. I've organized it around key topics that illustrate my learning path, allowing me to track my progress and revisit important concepts as needed.

### Key Topics Covered

- **Analytical Functions**: Diving into ranking functions like `RANK()` and `DENSE_RANK()` to analyze data sets.
- **Conditional Logic**: Gaining insights into how to use `CASE` statements for flexible querying.
- **Aggregation**: Mastering common functions such as `SUM()`, `COUNT()`, and `AVG()` to summarize and analyze data.
- **Database Creation**: Building a simulated online store database from scratch to understand relational structures.
- **Joins**: Exploring various types of joins (`INNER`, `LEFT`, and `FULL OUTER JOIN`) to combine data from multiple tables effectively.
- **Indexing & Views**: Learning to create indexes for query optimization and using views to simplify complex queries.
- **Date & Time Functions**: Manipulating date and time data to gain insights into temporal trends.
- **Debugging**: Facing real-world challenges by learning from syntax errors and optimizing query performance.
